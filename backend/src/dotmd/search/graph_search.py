"""Graph-based search engine for dotMD.

Expands seed chunk IDs (typically supplied by the semantic or keyword
engines via the fusion layer) by traversing the knowledge graph and
scoring neighbouring section nodes.

    """Search engine that exploits the knowledge graph for relevance signals.

    Unlike :class:`SemanticSearchEngine` and :class:`FTS5SearchEngine`,
    this engine does **not** operate on the raw query text.  Instead it
    requires a set of *seed* chunk IDs (produced by another engine) and
    discovers related sections by walking the graph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    graph_store:
        A graph store satisfying :class:`GraphStoreProtocol`.
    metadata_store:
        A metadata store satisfying :class:`MetadataStoreProtocol`.

        For each seed chunk the engine calls

        Every discovered node is scored using:

        .. code-block:: text

        Scores are aggregated across all seeds so that nodes reachable
        from multiple seeds receive a boost.

        Parameters
        ----------
        query:
            The original query string.  Accepted for protocol
            compatibility but **not used** by this engine.
        top_k:

        seed_chunk_ids:
            Starting chunk IDs for graph traversal.  If ``None`` or
            empty, an empty list is returned immediately.

        Returns
        -------
        list[tuple[str, float]]
